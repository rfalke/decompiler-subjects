The decompiler assumes that the segment '__nl_symbol_ptr' is read-only because of its NAME.
All data references to the segment will be replaced by constant values.
This may lead to drastic changes in the decompiler output.
If the segment is not read-only, please change the segment NAME.

In general, the decompiler checks the segment permissions, class, and name
to determine if it is read-only.
